    {1 Worker pool scheduling}

    A worker pool has a limited number of worker threads.
    Each worker pops one tagged item from the queue in a round-robin fashion.
    While the item is executed the tag temporarily doesn't participate in round-robin scheduling.
    If during execution more items get queued with the same tag they get redirected to a private queue.
    Once the item finishes execution the tag will participate in RR scheduling again.

    This ensures that items with the same tag do not get executed in parallel,
    and that a tag with a lot of items does not starve the execution of other tags.

    {1 Example usage}

        type t = string

        let execute op = print_endline op
      end

          type task = Operation.t -> unit
          type t = Operation.t * task

          let describe (op, _) = Rpc.rpc_of_string op
          let diagnostics _ = Rpc.rpc_of_unit ()

          let execute (op, f) = f op

          let finally _ = ()
        end)

        WorkerPool.push pool "tag1" ("Start" , Operation.execute);

  (** [create ?should_keep n] create a worker pool with [n] initial workers.
      If [should_keep current previous] is provided it is used to coalesce work items,
      it determines whether the [current] work item should be retained knowing that the [previous] items in the queue exist.

  (** [set_size pool n] sets the worker [pool] size to [n]. *)
  val set_size : t -> int -> unit

  (** [push pool tag item] pushes [item] at the end of queue for [pool].
      Items with the same [tag] are serialised, but items with different tags
      can be executed in parallel if enough workers are available.
      [tag]s get scheduled in a round-robin fashion.

      You need to start some workers, otherwise none of the items get executed.
